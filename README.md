## 📌 Project Workflow

1. **Importing necessary libraries**  
   Libraries such as `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `Scikit-learn`, `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib` are used for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

2. **Loading Tomato Plant Dataset**  
   The dataset containing sensor measurements is loaded for preprocessing and model training.

3. **Preprocessing**  
   - Scaling the features  
   - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets  

4. **Training & Evaluating the Model**  
   - Building a deep learning model with Keras/TensorFlow  
   - Training on the preprocessed dataset  
   - Evaluating using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

5. **Making Predictions**  
   - Using the trained model to predict water stress conditions  
   - Insights can be used for irrigation scheduling and monitoring crop health

## 📊 Dataset
The application works with **Bioristor sensor data** collected from tomato plants.  
Example CSV format:
| feature1 | feature2 | ... | status | y |
|----------|----------|-----|-------|---|
| 0.12     | 0.85     | ... | Healthy | 0 |
| 0.09     | 0.70     | ... | Stressed| 1 |

- **`status`** → Plant health status (**Healthy, Uncertainty, Recovery, Stress**).  
- **`y`** → Drought condition (**0 = No Drought**, **1 = Drought**).
